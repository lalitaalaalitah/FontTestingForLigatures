## Use these generate files to test your Devanagari Fonts.

## For Other Fonts related to other scripts:

    Use aksharamukha[https://github.com/virtualvinodh/aksharamukha] to convert files and test with your fonts.

## Note

    * Please, remember that this script generates ligatures with combination of upto 5 consonants.

    * You may increase the number of consonants in a ligatures. But, note that permutations for 5 consonants make a file of size 27 GB and combinations for same creates a file of 221 MB.

    * If your PC/MAC/Linux can't handle this type of computation and hangs, then do not try.

    * I can not upload those big text files, since Github limit is 100 MB for free accounts.
